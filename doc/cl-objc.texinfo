@section What is CL-ObjC?
CL-ObjC is a Common Lisp library whose aim is to allow developers to use
libraries written in the Objective C language, providing a lisp-like
interface towards Objective C conventions.

Actually it is made of 4 different interfaces. 

The first one provided by the package @lw{OBJC-CFFI} exposes the CFFI
bindings to the user and allows to handle Objective C objects through
Common Lisp objects via the CFFI foreign type translators mechanism.

The second one, you can find in the OBJC-READER package, provides a
reader macro that allows user to mix ObjectiveC and Common Lisp syntax
just to call Objective C methods.

The third one provided by the package @lw{CL-OBJC} gives to the users
the ability to write application in a Common Lisp-like way.

The last one provided by @lw{OBJC-CLOS} maps every Objective C
class/method to a CLOS class/method with names interned in the @lw{OBJC}
package. So the user can code in a CLOS fashion mixing the strength of
both object systems.

This manual is a work in progress. If you have difficulty using or
comprehending it please contact @email{cl-objc-devel@@common-lisp.net,
the developers} with details.

@section Status
At the moment CL-ObjC has been tested mainly on x86-64 platform on
Darwin with the last stable release of sbcl. CL-ObjC is known also to
work on Allegro 8.1. As CL-ObjC uses CFFI to link with the Objective C
runtime foreign functions, it should not be a problem to use it portably
on other platforms, compilers or OSs.

@section Download and installation
You can get the current development version of CL-ObjC from the darcs
repository on @uref{http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-objc/darcs/cl-objc/}

CL-ObjC is packaged using the ASDF library, so once downloaded the code
you should change the asdf:*central-registry* parameter to make asdf
find the cl-objc.asd file, or you can make a symbolic link of it in a
directory already in asdf:*central-registry*.

To build CL-ObjC you need to get a recent (at least from February 2007)
version of CFFI. You can get the development version from the darcs
repository at @uref{http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/darcs/cffi/}.

In order to work CL-ObjC needs to find the libobjc library. By default
it will search for it in /usr/lib. Change *foreign-library-directories*
if you want to load libobjc from a different path.

To run tests bundled with CL-ObjC you need the FiveAM test unit
software, then you can eval:

@lisp
(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'cl-objc)
(asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'cl-objc)
@end lisp

@node Tutorial
@chapter Tutorial

@section Quick start
The purpose of CL-ObjC is to allow to use Objective C with Lisp-like
syntax. Actually we can do that with four equivalent way. For the
impatient an ObjC call like:

@verbatim
[my_obj doSomethingCoolAt: now withThisParam 5]
@end verbatim

can be equivalently be executed in CL-ObjC

@itemize
* using the low level facility in the package OBJC-CFFI :
  @lisp
; specifying argument types
(typed-objc-msg-send (my-obj "doSomethingCoolAt:withThisParam") 
		     'objc-id now 
		     :int 5)
; without argument types
(untyped-objc-msg-send my-obj "doSomethingCoolAt:withThisParam" now 5)
  @end lisp

* using the reader macro in the package OBJC-READER :
  @lisp
[my-obj doSomethingCoolAt: now withThisParams 5]
  @end lisp

* using the interface provided by the package CL-OBJC :
  @lisp
(invoke my-obj :do-something-cool-at now :with-this-param 5)
  @end lisp

* using the CLOS interface
  @lisp
;; you can alloc new instances with (make-instance 'objc:ns-foo)

(objc:do-something-cool-at?-with-this-param? my-obj now 5)
  @end lisp
@end itemize

So every message call can be specified in a typed or untyped way, i.e.
expliciting the CFFI type of the arguments or not, or mixing the two
approach. Actually if types are available the compiler can optimize the
message call. The CLOS interface have to be enabled first because it is
disabled by default.

@section Loading Frameworks
Once loaded CL-ObjC we can use existing Objective C classes and methods
loading frameworks with the macro 
@ref{Macro objc-cffi:use-objc-framework,,@code{USE-OBJC-FRAMEWORK}}:

@example
(use-objc-framework "Foundation"
  (define-objc-struct ns-range 
    (location :unsigned-int) 
    (length :unsigned-int)))
@end example

In the body of this macro you can optionally include custom CFFI
definitions, usually useful to define better names for structs and
fields, because it is not possible to get them at runtime.

If you want to enable the CLOS interface you need to set the

@ref{Variable objc-clos:*automatic-definitions-update*,,
@code{objc-clos:*automatic-definitions-update*}} to @lw{t} before
loading the framework. 

@section Type translations

Objective C types are translated directly into Common Lisp types.
Primitive C types (float, int, char *) are translated by CFFI in the
common way. Struct values as in CFFI are always managed by a pointer to
their data. The specific Objective C types (like @code{id}) are
translated automatically by foreign type translators into lisp types and
viceversa when needed. Several CLOS classes are added to handle them and
custom @var{print-object} and @var{describe-object} are provided in the
OBJC-CFFI package. The following types translators are installed:


@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .33
@item @emph{Objective C type} @tab @emph{Description} @tab @emph{Lisp type}
@item @code{SEL} @tab selectors @tab @code{objc-selector}
@item @code{objc_class} @tab Class description @tab @code{objc-class}
@item @code{id} @tab Instance Object @tab @code{objc-object}
@item @code{objc_method} @tab Method Object @tab @code{objc-method}
@item @code{objc_method_list} @tab List of Methods @tab a list or an objc-method
@item @code{objc_ivar} @tab Instance variable @tab @code{objc-ivar}
@item @code{objc_ivar_list} @tab Instance variable lists @tab @code{objc-ivar-list}
@end multitable

You can also use normal string to specify classes or selectors in the
OBJC-CFFI package and they will be translated to the type needed.

@xref{CLOS Wrappers} to read documentation about type translation with
CLOS wrappers.

@section Name translators
In the CL-OBJC package you don't specify class and selector by strings
but with symbols. To see how a given ObjC or Lisp name will be
translated by the bridge, you can use the following functions:

@lisp
(objc-class-name-to-symbol string)
(symbol-to-objc-class-name symbol)
(objc-selector-to-symbols string)
(symbols-to-objc-selector symbol-list-or-symbol)
@end lisp

So for example the class ``NSObject'' is translated to ns-object, the
class ``VeryImportant'' to very-important and so on. You can add strings
to the special variable @var{*acronyms*} in order to not espand acronyms
like URL into u-r-l.

A selector name is translated in a list of symbols or a single symbol. 

@table @code
@item [NSObject alloc]
(invoke 'ns-object alloc)

@item [obj setX: 3 Y: 5]
(invoke obj :set-x 3 :y 5)

@item [NSNumber numberWithInt: 3]
(invoke 'ns-number :number-with-int 3)
@end table

@xref{CLOS Wrappers} to read documentation about name translations with
CLOS wrappers.

@section Utilities
Several macros are present for the sake of convenience. 

@subsection The slet, slet* macro

The CL-OBJC:slet* and CL-OBJC:slet* macro are used to handle data stored
in structs. They bind variable to new allocated (or not if you provide
a value) structs and provide lisp accessor to their fields.

@example
@lisp
(defun make-rect (x y width height)
  (slet* ((rect ns-rect)
	  (size ns-size (ns-rect-size rect))
	  (point ns-point (ns-rect-origin rect)))
    (setf (ns-point-x point) (coerce x 'float)
	  (ns-point-y point) (coerce y 'float)
	  (ns-size-width size) (coerce width 'float)
	  (ns-size-height size) (coerce height 'float))
    rect))
@end lisp
@end example


@subsection with-object and objc-let
As a common snippet Objective C code pattern is @code{[[MyClass alloc]
initWithParam param]} it is provided the macro @var{CL-OBJC:objc-let}
that binds variables to new allocated and initialized object. So the
previous examples becomes @code{(objc-let ((obj my-class
:init-with-param param)) ...)}.

Another common situation is to call several methods with the same
receiver (e.g. self). For the sake of convenience it is provided the
@var{with-object} macro. So the Objective C code
@example
[obj methodA]
[obj methodB: param1 C: param2]
[obj methodD: param1]
@end example

becomes in the CL-ObjC syntax:

@example
@lisp
(with-object obj
  (method-a)
  (:method-b param1)
  (:method-c param1 :c param2)
  (:method-d: param1))
@end lisp
@end example

@section Using Interface Builder: the Currency Converter Example
This section concerns the construction of a Cocoa application using an
UI built with XCode. You can find the instructions to use the Interface
Builder tool to build the interface used in the example at

@url{http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/}.

A Cocoa application is usally deployed as a bundle. A bundle is just a
directory containing all the resources (images, sounds, data) the
application needs. Interface Builder saves descriptions of UI in
serialized objects saved in file in the NIB file format stored in the
bundles.

If you follow the instructions of the quoted Cocoa tutorial you will
find in the directory project your bundle, namingly a folder with the
.app extension.

In order to have a Cocoa application using NIB files and integrated with
OSX you have to put a link (symbolic or not) to sbcl and a script
launching your Cocoa lisp application into the MacOS subfolder of your
bundle. Usually the script execute sbcl to load and launch your code.

Note that in that script you can create a swank server you can attach to
allowing live debugging of your application@footnote{You can find an
example of this script in the cl-objc bundle}.

Let's load the frameworks used in our applications:

@table @strong
@item Objective C code
Lisp code

@item #import "Foundation/foundation.h"
@code{(define-objc-framework "Foundation")}

@item #import "AppKit/AppKit.h"
@code{(define-objc-framework "AppKit"
   (cffi:defcvar "NSApp" objc-id))}

@item #import "Cocoa/Cocoa.h"
@code{(define-objc-framework "Cocoa")}
@end table

The @code{CFFI:defcvar} binds the variable @code{*nsapp*} to a static
variabile used by the Cocoa framework.

Then we can define the class definitions for the model and for the
controller of the GUI using the DEFINE-OBJC-CLASS macro found in the
CL-OBJC package.
@lisp
(define-objc-class converter ns-object
  ())

(define-objc-class converter-controller ns-object
  ((converter objc-id)
   (first-currency-field objc-id)
   (other-currency-field objc-id)
   (rate-field objc-id)))
@end lisp

The DEFINE-OBJC-CLASS macro gets three arguments, the name of the class
and of the superclass transformed with the name translators cited
before, and the a list of instance variable definitions.

So the @var{converter-controller} class will be added to the Objective C
runtime class list with the name ``ConverterController'' and defines 4
instance variables with ObjC names: ``converter'',
``firstCurrencyField'', ``otherCurrencyField'', ``rateField''.

Then we can define the methods with the CL-OBJC:DEFINE-OBJC-METHOD
macro:

@example
@lisp
(define-objc-method :convert (:return-type :void)
    ((self converter-controller) (sender objc-id))
  (declare (ignore sender))
  (with-ivar-accessors converter-controller
    (let* ((currency (invoke (first-currency-field self) float-value))
	   (rate (invoke (rate-field self) float-value))
	   (amount (invoke (converter self) :convert-currency currency :at-rate rate)))
      (invoke (other-currency-field self) :set-float-value amount)
      (invoke (rate-field self) :select-text self))))

(define-objc-method (:convert-currency :at-rate) (:return-type :float)
    ((self converter) (currency :float) (rate :float))
  (* currency rate))
@end lisp
@end example

This macro gets 3 arguments plus the body of the method. The name of the
related selector specified with a symbol or a list of symbols, a list of
option and a list of argument definition made of the argument name and
its CFFI type. The argument named @emph{self} is mandatory and will
binded to the receiver of the message. The body will be evaluated also
with the symbol @emph{sel} binded to the selector object of the method.

So the second definition in the example define the instance method named
``convertCurrency:atRate:'' returning a :float. It accepts 2 arguments
and it is binded to the class converter.

The @var{with-ivar-accessors} macro establishes useful accessors to read
and modify instance variables of ObjectiveC objects.

At last the main entry point of our application looks like:

@lisp
(defun converter ()
  (invoke 'ns-application shared-application)
  (invoke 'ns-bundle :load-nib-named (lisp-string-to-nsstring "MainMenu") :owner *nsapp*)
  (invoke *nsapp* run))
@end lisp

If we activate the reader macro we can specify NSString object using the
at-sign so (lisp-string-to-nsstring ``MainMenu'') becomes @@"MainMenu''

@chapter Reader Macro

@section Introduction
The reader macro allows the user to mix ObjectiveC and Common Lisp code.

When the macro dispatch character ``[`` is readed, then the reader
excepts a symbol naming a class (read preserving case), then selectors
and arguments. Arguments are read using the default Common Lisp
readtable. In order to send methods to instance objects you can use the
``,'' (comma) character to read and eval symbols with the standard
readtable. For the sake of convenience it is provided the @@ (at-sign)
macro that build @var{NSString} objects.

@node CLOS Wrappers
@chapter CLOS Wrappers

@section Enabling and caching CLOS wrappers
If you want to enable the CLOS interface you need to set the
@ref{Variable objc-clos:*automatic-definitions-update*,,
@code{objc-clos:*automatic-definitions-update*}} to @lw{t} before
loading the framework.

After setting the variable the call to @code{use-objc-framework} takes a
bit of time to collect just at compile time informations and generate
CLOS classes and methods. To help deploy and to make load of cl-objc
based application faster these definitions are cached in a file for each
framework.

if you want at any time sync the CLOS definitions without setting you
can use @ref{Function objc-clos:update-clos-definitions,,
@code{objc-clos:update-clos-definitions}}

@section Value Translation
If you use the CLOS interface the return value of Objective C calls will
be translated to CLOS instances of the corresponding class using
@ref{Function objc-clos:convert-result-from-objc,, convert-result-from-objc}. So
a call to
@lisp
(objc:init-with-utf8-string? s "foo")
@end lisp

returns a new instance of the CLOS class @lw{objc:ns-c-f-string}
corresponding to the Objective C class @lw{NSCFString}.
