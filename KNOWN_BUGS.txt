* passing structs by value is not fully supported (we are using an
  hack to overcome the actual limits of CFFI)

* As ObjC use a different convention to push arguments for variadic
  functions (it doesn't do argument promotion), we can't use normal
  defcfun but we are using internal methods of CFFI
